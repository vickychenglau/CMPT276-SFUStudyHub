```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:heroku/ruby-getting-started.git
$ cd ruby-getting-started
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate
$ heroku local
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

## Docker

The app can be run and tested using the [Heroku Docker CLI plugin](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/local-development-with-docker-compose).

Make sure the plugin is installed:

    heroku plugins:install heroku-docker

Configure Docker and Docker Compose:

    heroku docker:init

And run the app locally:

    docker-compose up web

The app will now be available on the Docker daemon IP on port 8080.

To work with the local database and do migrations, you can open a shell:

    docker-compose run shell
    bundle exec rake db:migrate

You can also use Docker to release to Heroku:

    heroku create
    heroku docker:release
    heroku open
